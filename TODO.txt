1. sort the train_labels in data_preprocessing
2. append train_label in data_preprocessing
3. load the dataframe in Convolutional_network.py
4. make the convolutional layers
5. make the entire model
6. make a predict for the model and test its accuracy
7. optimize the model
8. make sure the whole project can be easy converted to other environments
9. make the django website (backend and frontend)
10. make a database where all the weights are stored
11. make the file that does the predictions based on the model with its weights(from that database)
12. secure the server and website and check for vulnerabilities
13. look for a good way to publicate it
